#variable naming convention:
                          #use lower case for variable names,as in radius and area.

# using the lowercase and uppercase in betweeen such as numberOFStudents.this naming style is known as camelcase because the uppercase characters in the name resemble a camel's hump.



#camel case:1 word in betwwen is uppercase characters
#myName=ravi     


#snake case: __ this character is used after every character for multiword lines.
#my_name_is_=ravi                    used for multiple words in sn 1 variable


#pascalcase: every character of first word in the line is uppercase character.
# MyNameIsRavi=1



                                  #variables,assignment statements and expressions



#we can name a variable like this :
#1. hello
#2. hello_1
#3. hello1
#4. HELLO
#5. 1 
#6. Roll_No
#7. SL_n6



#we cannot give name to variables like this :
#1. 1hello
#2. 1_hello
#3. no special characters can be used rather than ____ this
   #hello??
   #(hello)
 # roll no
#4. 1=a 
#5. "age"
   
   
   
# there are some reserved words that cannot be used as a variables.












#identifiers
#identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as variables and functions in a program.
         #number1,number2,number3,average,input,eval and print are the name of the things that appear in program.

#in programming terminology such names are called identifiers.


    #an identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letter,digits,and underscores(__).
    #an identifier must start with a letter or an underscore.it cannot start with a digit.
    #an identifier cannot be a keyword.(see appendix A,python keywords,for a list of keywords.)
                    #keywords,also called reserved words.  have special meaning in python.
                    #import is a keyword, which tells the python interpreter to import a module to the program.
   #an identifier can be of any length.


#legal identifiers
               #area, radius and number1.


#whereas 2A and d+4 are not because they don't follow the rules.
                                                   #it is reported as a syntax error.

#note:
    #python is case sensitive language , so area, Area , AREA all are diferent.



#descriptive names:
                 #descriptive identifiers make programs easy to read.
