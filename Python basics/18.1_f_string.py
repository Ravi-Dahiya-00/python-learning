name='krishna'
age=18
height=1.6



#we have tp right like this
print("my name is ", name,"my age is ",str(age),"my height is ",str(height))
#this is more error full method because if we forget a comma or to right str this will give some kind of error.

#f_string is good method to solve this problem
print(f"my name is {name} my age is {age} my height is {height}")

#this is good method and it will be less errorless and saves a lot of time in programming.




#we can also do some expressions in the curly brackets also.
print(f"krishna's father age is {age*2} ")
