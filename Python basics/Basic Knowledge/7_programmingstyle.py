#few guidelines for writing good programming style and proper documentation.


#1. appropriate comments and comment style:
                                  # must include a summary about the code in beginning and with every major step.



#2. proper spacing:
         # a consistent spacing style makes program clear and easy to read, and it also makes it easier to debug.

# print(3+4*5)                           #wrong style

# print(3 + 4 * 5)                      #good style







#writing a simple program
#writing a program involves designing a strategy for solving the problem and then using a programming language to implement that srategy.
