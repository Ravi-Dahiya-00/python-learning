#for swapping the numbers 
#if wants to make the value of a to b and the value of b to a then we will swap the numbers by using the swapping function
a=input("enter your first number:")
b=input("enter your second number:")
third=a
a=b
b=third
print("a=",a)
print("b=",a)





#also written as 

#this + sign can also be used to concatenate the two different things such aS STRING and a number.
a=input("enter your first number:")
b=input("enter your second number:")
third=a
a=b
b=third
print("a=" + b)
print("b=" + b)

#this is used to concatenate a string and a number.








x=1
y=2
temp=x       #save x in a temp variable
x=y          #assign the value in y to x
y=temp       #assign the value in temp to y

#simplify the task using the following statement to swap the values of x and y.

x,y=y,x   #swap x with y
