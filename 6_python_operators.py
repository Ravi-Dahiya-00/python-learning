#precedence and associativity in python 

#  operators have different levels of precedence, which determine the order in which they are evaluated. 

#PEM-DAS        it is the algorithm to calculate the mathematical operations 
#1.     ()                                parenthesis
#2.     **                                power operator                                                          right<--left
#3.     *  /   //   %                    multiplication,division,floor division,modules                           left-->right

#which will come first it will be operated first.
#in that first               multiplication  >>  division  >>  addition  >>  subtraction

 



#the best way is to use parenthesis after every operator it will be time consuming but give less errors.
#if we need some fix output from the same digits parenthesis will be required.


#if we want 11 from the same digits we will use it like this:
