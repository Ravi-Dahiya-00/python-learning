# for starting a new a line and continue the same statement
#but in the next line we use \n
print('hello friends \nthis is my first code')  #\n for new line

#for using double cot in between the lines we use \''
print('he is a \'good\'boy')
#for coting good in comma we use \'good\'



#sometimes python interpreter cannot determine the end of the statement written in multiple lines. we can place the LINE CONTINUATIONAL SYMBOL (\)  at the end of the line to tell the interpreter that the statement is continued on the next line.
#example:

sum=1+2+3+4+5\
+6+7
 #it is equivalent to
sum=1+2+3+4+5+6+9+6
